## Feb 2025
Currently optimizing svgs,imgs, and working with the client to secure their new domain. 

## Tools Used:
React, Node.js, 11ty, Nunjucks, Html, SASS, JavaScript, Decap CMS, Netlify

## Optimizations & SEO:
- JSON-LD schema added to help web crawlers identify important info
- robot.txt used to help guide search engines to the site map
- Implemented Responsive Image Delivery by using lazy loading for images and background elements, ensuring properly sized images based on screen width, reducing unnecessary resource usage, and improving Core Web Vitals and mobile load speeds.
- Improved Font Rendering & Performance: Hosted fonts locally and preloaded them, preventing content shifts and enhancing Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).
- Optimized CSS & JavaScript: Minified and deferred non-essential scripts, applied Critical CSS to prioritize above-the-fold content, and used lazy loading & code splitting in React, reducing render-blocking issues and improving first contentful paint (FCP).
- Utilized Performance Monitoring Tools: Used Google Analytics, Screaming Frog, PageSpeed Insights, and Google Search Console to resolve SEO gaps, and architectural flaws, and improve site indexing.
- Optimized SVGs by reducing unnecessary data and using inline SVGs where applicable, enhancing load speeds and visual clarity.
- Applied async  to all images, prioritizing content rendering and improving perceived page speed.
- Managed and optimized sitemaps, JSON-LD, robots.txt, and canonical tags, ensuring proper indexing and crawling for improved search visibility.
- Optimized React components with lazy loading, tree-shaking, and code-splitting techniques, improving load times and Core Web Vitals scores.
